# Winbox

This is a prototype that CMs will use to easily create & submit wins to Jira. There are two main utilities of this prototype:

1. Enable CMs to paste "win" text into a UI that automatically renders their submission into an image format
2. Enable CMs to easily access the Jira issue collector, with relevant fields pre-completed based on their initial inputs

## How this was built

This prototype is built on Jekyll, which is mainly for the sake of using a template for common parts of each page (i.e., the <head> section). If necessary, we could pull it out of Jekyll and have it be simple HTML, CSS, and JS files. Given that there are currently only 3 pages in this prototype, this wouldn't be terribly cumbersome to do.

## Hosting and URL

Pots' original plan was to have this hosted on Github Pages via the MSH Github account. Even if this changes, the intent is for the prototype to live at winbox.mainstreethub.com. There is currently an IT ticket created for this task (setting up the subdomain) that Stephen is paused on â€“ he's waiting for us to have the hosting stuff figured out.

## Remaining work

As of Thursday afternoon, there some minor additions to the code (copy, design assets) Pots will need to make during the week of January 15th.
